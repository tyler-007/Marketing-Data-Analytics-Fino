What should be my primary card? I would really like it if you could she some light on this. I know we only spend a little so I am not after max reward points. I use my CCs because I usually do not like to have real money or my wallet with me. When I do not have my wallet with me, I feel so good, because I tend to lose it every now and then. And carrying a CC is handy!  I have the following cards, 1. Amazon Pay ICICI (5.2L CC Limit) 2. IndusInd Signature Legend (1L) 3. Axis Neo (36k) 4. HDFC Moneyback+ (90k) 5. ICICI Coral (shares CC limit with my Amazon Pay CC, I guess) 6. Airtel Axis CC (Application under review) My monthly and/or yearly spending is as below, 1. Fuel - 4-5k per month (I prefer BPCL only, using Moneyback+) 2. Grocery - 3k (DMart primarily, and things that we miss out are from BBasket) 3. Zomato - 1k max (currently using Axis Neo, since I have and option to avail 120 off twice per month) 4. Rent - 15k (always through UPI to my landlord) 5. Internet and Mobile - 590/- (Airtel Fibre); Mobile Recharges (3 Airtel, and 1 Vodafone) I do it for about 6 months or 84 days through Amazon Pay Mobile app with Amazon&#39;s CC 6. Dining - less than 1.5k per month (mostly using HDFC Moneyback+) 7. LIC yearly 160k (through Amazon, using Amazon&#39;s CC) Once did it with HDFC and I am guessing I was given a gift voucher of 1000/- 8. Car Due (gets debited automatically from Savings Account) 9. Things that we buy from Retail shops - I randomly use anyone of these two (Axis Neo, Moneyback +) 10. Health Insurance for my parents - 50k yearly (used my HDFC Moneyback+, got rewarded with 500/- voucher) Completely stopped using Coral from ICICI as I HAVE NEVER MANAGED TO REAP ANY REWARD POINTS.   And I am finding it overwhelming to keep track of the due dates and due amount, however I have managed to pay my dues on or before my due dates. So far, so good.

My expenses are as follows:  Ola/uber/blu/metro- 10k per month Online food - 2k per month Offline food via UPI - 3k per month Online shopping (amazon) - 5k [this is my &#39;treat-yourself&#39; money and not really a monthly expense]  I have the following credit cards in mind and have also highlighted some (subjective) cons pertaining to the cards:  HDFC tata neu infinity - the cashback is limited to neu coins and honestly I do not use tata neu. Can anyone with this card tell me what did you use your neu coins on? HDFC swiggy - it seemed like a nice card but the cashback gets credited as swiggy money and I don&#39;t use swiggy a lot. Airtel axis - this card seemed nice until I realised that the airtel cashback is capped to 300 per month for prepaid, postpaid, broadband ALL COMBINED. My airtel bill comes to about 3k per month so I will surely cap the limit. On top of this the card also provides 10% cb capped to 500 pm for swiggy, zomato and big basket. Seems nice considering that the cb is credited directly to the cc account. SBI cashback - this card seems like a solid one and I&#39;m inclined to get it. The only &#39;con&#39; seems to be the 999 annual fee and I&#39;m not sure if I can meet the 2L fee waiver criteria.  Please do share your thoughts with me as to which card I should go for!

Get directly from the offline shop. Since you are traveling, you can also purchase it from a vendor near the toll plaza. In fact, you can find ICICI there nowadays. Usually, ICICI, IDFC, and Airtel are available there, and they get instantly activated with KYC being done on the spot. Alternatively, you can complete the KYC later.

Hello
Yes, all the fastags will be linked to the Airtel wallet and any deduction due to passing of tolls by any of the cars will be directly deducted from the wallet.
I have been using Airtel fastags for 3 of my cars and operate all of them from an Airtel wallet linked to a single mobile number through the Airtel Thanks app.
Hope that helps.

If you think your experience until now has been abysmal, you have a party waiting for you! I've had an account with Airtel Payments Bank for a while now.
Everything started off very smooth and rosy until a year or so back when Airtel sneakily started adding charges for various things. They started sending messages such as ""Rs. 10 (or so) will be charged as SMS delivery charges from so-and-so-date. Call Customer Care to opt-out"". Then ""Rs. 100 will be charged as Account Maintenance Charges. Call Customer Care to opt-out"".
This is in essence a step short of fraud.
So, when I cancelled my Paytm Fastag, I didn't even consider Airtel. I'm now inclined to even close my Airtel Payments Bank account.

My recent encounter with Airtel wallet, payment bank account, and Airtel Fastag has been utterly abysmal. Previously, I had been smoothly navigating through transactions using the PayTM wallet, bank and Fastag until the recent regulatory restrictions imposed on PayTM by the RBI. I thought of changing my HDFC Fastag (was never happy with their services) first before switching my PayTM Fastags to other banks.
Attempting to procure an Airtel Fastag for one of my vehicles (with HDFC Fastag) through the Airtel Thanks app proved to be a labyrinthine ordeal. Well, I need an airtel wallet first to order a Fastag. Oh, I already have an airtel wallet. (I had linked my Airtel postpaid account to PayTM bank long time back for auto debit and they created an airtel UPI and wallet without my consent or they must have tricked me in doing so). Ignoring that I ordered an Airtel Fastag through the app on February 8th, with a promised delivery date of February 12th.
Trying to check the status of Fastag through the Airtel Thanks app, incessantly pushed me to open an Airtel payment bank account. However, attempting to do so through the app led me on a fruitless merry-go-round of providing Aadhaar and PAN details, followed by uploading a selfie. After an hour of futile attempts, I abandoned the endeavor and decided to visit an Airtel store instead.
At the store, the process of opening an Airtel payment bank account was completed almost instantaneously after providing my PAN and Aadhaar details.  I was informed that opening Airtel payment bank account couldn't have been done through the app, despite the app suggesting otherwise. Anyways had a smooth experience at Airtel store.
Frustrations mounted when attempting to check the status of my Airtel Fastag, buried beneath layers of the app's interface and inexplicably marked as ""validating,"" despite the order being placed two days prior.
Contacting customer support proved to be an exercise in futility, with labyrinthine IVR systems and clueless representatives. After an arduous and exasperating conversation, I discovered that my Fastag was supposedly active, despite never being delivered to me.
Furthermore, I was informed that my Airtel wallet had been closed and converted into an Airtel payment bank account (without my consent.) That was the reason I was unable to see the Fastag transaction on my account.
The ordeal continued with contradictory instructions regarding the status of the Fastag, which ultimately led to the suggestion of visiting an Airtel store for a temporary Fastag with limited functionality (cannot be used for transactions at toll plaza), till the Fastag is delivered in about 14 days.
Till yesterday it was 14 days delivery time. Today morning I got a message that my Airtel Fastag is out for delivery. Shows how clueless the customer care is.
In essence, the experience with Airtel's banking and Fastag services has been characterized by disorganization, inefficiency, and a complete disconnect between the various components of the Airtel ecosystem.

1. Yes and the wallet can be recharged by linking any other bank account to airtel UPI.
2. Airtel wallet is accessible to customers even without an airtel connection so I think you would just need to download the Airtel Thanks app and it should work.
The Airtel SBA isn't mandatory for anything, it would make things more streamlined but I think the Fastag links to the wallet which can be auto recharged via a standing instruction or an easier version of it if you're in the Airtel ecosystem.

- Thanks for the heads-up.
- I have been an Airtel wallet customer for about an year but with barely 10-12 transactions till date. The wallet is also a part of the ""Airtel Payments Bank"" but requires only a ""minimum KYC"" which I am assuming is same as the KYC done for the Airtel SIM, in essence the Aadhar. This has a limit of 10,000 and is intended for bill payments, recharges and Fastag.
With ""minimum KYC"" I can also use the UPI by linking it to another bank account.
I haven't completed a year but I haven't paid any charges for this service at any point in time and nor was it ever mentioned in any of the workflows.
Also it doesn't make sense since I am depositing money with them on which they don't give me any interest like a normal savings bank account.
There could be transaction/platform charges like Paytm used to add but  it is unlikely that there will be any maintenance charges on this service.
Now there is another section which I haven't used is the Savings Bank Account(SBA) which is the one being talked about in the earlier point by Ananthponraj in post #252. The fees and charges are applicable to that I reckon. This needs a full KYC to be done and as mentioned in the website can be done online and I am assuming by visiting Airtel Care centers too.
This is similar to the
Paytm Payments Bank Savings Account
and will operate like any other savings bank accounts.",2024-02-06 12:10:00,,https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/street-experiences/219559-who-your-preferred-fastag-provider-17.html,,Ranchi,Jharkhand,India,,,,,,,,,,,,team-bhp,,,,,,,,,,,,en, , , , , , ,,,

But  now passed through a bill by suspending opposition 145 MPs to by pass spectrum auction.
The only player got the allocation without auction was Bharati Airtel.
Bharati paid 300% it's profit 150cr via Electrol bond to BJP. 
  Quoted Tweet : @sharmasupriya : #BREAKING
Remember 2G scam?

SC ordered compulsory spectrum auction in 2012 and Modi rode to power

But in 2023,&#8203; Modi govt did away with auction for satellite spectrum

Decision coincided with Bharti group donating Rs 150 crore to BJP

We sent them our Airtel Landline Phone Bill but their customer care and then Head Customer Care REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT mentioning that they don't consider Private companies for the utility bill. Isn't it the most crazy thing being said by a PRIVATE BANK ITSELF?? Also RBI has clearly mentioned ANY SERVICE PROVIDER but they DON'T EVEN AGREE WITH RBI. DUMB IDIOTS.

Then we sent them our Election Card of our Permanent Address and guess what they come up with this time....??
They say that Election Card is not having the PIN number so that too is unacceptable... You see what level of IDIOTS have been employed by them.

So I've been frustrated dealing with Airtel Payments Bank regarding this fastag order. The tag for one car got issued and delivered in about 7-8 days, however the other order got stuck somewhere. I tried my level best to try and resolve this (phone/email), unfortunately the level of incompetence is incomprehensible. Finally I just asked them to cancel both my orders and refund the payment, and that too is pending since March 22nd, even after multiple follow-ups.
Today, I have escalated the issue from their site (not sure whether it even helps) and also emailed their grievance officer.
Anyway, please avoid Airtel Fastag, cause they tend to screw up every now and then. I understand that things can go wrong with any service provider, however with Airtel, there is no real hope in any resolution.
After all this, I went ahead with IDFC and the customer support is way better. I was also able to get the Rs 300 charged for their Max addon credited to my Fastag wallet. There was also an issue with auto recharge, which they did address in a timely manner with continuous followup from their side to ensure I was satisfied.
The tags too were delivered on the 2nd working day.",2024-03-31 16:43:00,,https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/street-experiences/276845-paytm-fastag-you-keeping-ditching-23.html,Male,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,team-bhp,,,,,,,,,,,,en, , , , , , ,,,
2024-03-28,Forums,MadrasTurbo,,Positive,"Carplay Box - iHeylinkit CP908 Review
Background
In car HU user experience for me is one of the very important aspects in a car, and though I was mostly satisfied with the OE HU on my Kia Seltos facelift, one thing that I was not a big fan of was the inbuilt Here Maps. It is not terrible but I have been so used to Live Google Maps on my previous car&#8217;s android HU, that I really missed it on the new car. Changing the HU was out of the question, and was not even considered, but I started looking at the available options to integrate live google maps to the HU.
Options Considered
Wired CarPlay/AA - This is the most straightforward way to get Google Maps and I am sure it would fit the bill for most of the users. I was also using this, but always missed the convenience, that I was used to, of just being able to use the application without a phone.
Wireless CarPlay/AA with a dongle - Costs anywhere from &#8377;6,500 and goes all the way up to &#8377;9,000 for some models. Has the same issues as the wired counterpart, but on top, it takes a hit on the phones battery, and if charged wirelessly, the phone heats up sometimes. I know many Kia/Hyundai users use such dongles and have a lot of positive feedback, so this option is also worth looking into.
Side loading .apk by accessing the engineering mode - While I was reading online, I came across an interesting thread on xda-developers where someone got access to the engineering mode and could sideload apks directly to the OEM HU. Though I badly wanted to do this, it was not that straight forward, and Kia has been making it harder and harder to access the engineering mode from what I am able to read. But also, with an OTA update, the side loaded apps most likely have to be reloaded. Also, there were other concerns like keeping the application updated, warranty woes, etc. So I dropped this idea.
Plug and Play Android Car Box a.k.a. CarPlay AI Box - Basically, an external device that uses the wired AA/CarPlay protocol to run a full fledged Android OS. Interestingly it also supports wireless CarPlay/AA through an application. Now this was the option that could potentially give me the same experience that I had with a proper Android HU, without having to tamper anything in the car. So I decided to buy one.
What to buy and from where?
There are a good number of options, and I am also seeing more local brands that generally rebrand and sell Android HUs, offering this product under various names - Smart AI Box, AI Car Box, Android Box, etc. But the problem was the pricing. In India, the local distributors seem to have a good markup (understandable as they have to extend warranty, support), and the prices for known brands like Carlinkit and Ottocast sometimes can even be close to &#8377;30,000.
Honestly I do not mind spending money on accessories like this which I would not be changing often, and buying an inferior specced product would ruin the experience, and in the end I may end up not using it at all. I try not to regret buying something. I paid around &#8377;25,000 including duties for an Android Head Unit 5 years back for my old car, as at that time, there was no one selling an OE fit for my car which was not so popular but also did not have high specs for the generic units. The product was expensive but it never gave any trouble till the day we had to part with our car.
When I was looking at the various products offered I noticed that the specs for a lot of them were identical, but they looked different and had a different name. It became clear that this is very similar to Android HUs, where brands procure from a handful of manufacturers with their custom branding or casing.  So I now just needed to find the right product and buy it from the right seller who offers good support and pricing.
I started looking through AliExpress and Alibaba for these products and there were so many options to choose from at prices as low as $50 all the way up to $400. After talking to multiple sellers and watching multiple videos and reviews online, I could generalize the products based on the processor used. There can be other products out there but the majority of them use the following chipsets.
Snapdragon based
QCM6490 - Expensive but one of the best available options today, supports 5G, for EU and Asia. Also supports Wifi6E.
SD662(6125) - Best VFM Chipset, supports 4G and should be the choice of most buyers.
SD665(6115) - Good performance, supports 4G and slightly cheaper than QM6125.
All the chipsets mentioned above are octa-core processors, There are other Mediatek and Rockchip based boxes that are slightly cheaper but might offer a different UI, or functionality.
Based on information available online, I was very impressed by the performance and features that the QM6490 based boxes offered and I was convinced that this was the one that I wanted to buy. No seller in India offered this product, so I had to import it directly from China. I have good experience with ordering stuff from China in the past, but that was all through AliExpress. Now, it is a little more challenging to order from China as most sellers do not want to ship single items on their own and the buyers as well have little to no protection. I got in touch with a company called as &#8220;iHeylinkit&#8221;, and what I really liked about them is the support that they offered. I had a lot of questions and was always given a detailed and polite answer for all my questions. I ordered the QM6490 based box from the same seller, which is called as the
&#8220;iHeyLinkit CP908&#8221; for about $380 (+duties)
via AliExpress to my EU residence. I believe it is also sold by other companies and you can find the product as &#8220;Exploter ApplePie Rocket&#8221;, &#8220;Navlynx ApplePie Rocket&#8221; etc.
The seller informed me that they would be willing to ship directly to India, so if anyone is interested, please take a look at their product line-up. You can reach them at +86 158 7619 4110 on WhatsApp.
Disclaimer: I am not linked to the company/seller in anyway. I fully paid for my goods, and my review of the product is solely based on my personal experience. Also important to note, I did not order directly and used AliExpress and had full buyer protection. So if anyone happens to buy directly, please be aware of all the possible risks and if possible, share your experience in this thread.
iHeylinkit CP 908
I will start with the overall pros and cons and then go into the details for those interested.
PROS
+Full Android 13 based OS
+Outstanding performance with zero lags
+8GB RAM with 128GB UFS2.1 storage with the ability to add a micro-SD card up to 128GB
+Dual BT 5.2
+Super quick boot time (less than 15 seconds)
+Built in GPS
+Wireless Android Auto/Apple Carplay
+5G connectivity
+Wi-Fi 6E
+HDMI Output which is capable of outputting different content for the HU and the rear entertainment unit
+In-Car Wi-Fi Hotspot
+Supports use of OEM GPS data (for supported cars)
+Integrates well with steering controls including the voice commands
+Full access to Google Play Store
+Supports accessories like an air remote(+$20), which can enable the rear seat passengers to control volume, change tracks, and also use the voice commands from the remote. I found this useful
+Split screen support to have more than one apps open
CONS
- $$$. Costs over &#8377;30,000. With shipping and duties, it can be significantly higher
- UI/UX. The hardware is so capable but the implemented UI/UX out of the box is very poor. System navigation, bloatware, old security patch with an OS that is already almost 2 years old now
- SIM card is not used only for data but also has messaging and calls like a normal phone. Maybe this is useful for someone but I cannot wrap my head around getting calls in the car from the sim I installed for data. No way to uninstall the phone and messaging app. I have now resorted to call barring and removed messaging permissions for the applications
- Hotspot has to be turned on every time manually, and there is not even a quick toggle. I resorted to using Tasker to trigger on boot
- Device can heat up quite a bit, so it is important to place it in a well ventilated area
- By default, while using wired Android Auto, pressing the voice command button on the steering once, opens Kia&#8217;s voice command, and long pressing opens the assistant, but for some reason both the actions only trigger the assistant with this box. Maybe I am missing some configuration, but I was not able to find a way to make this work properly
Unboxing
The product came well packed with an external cardboard box and bubble wrap. The product box is relatively small and was surprisingly well made. The box contained the following items.
The device itself
USB Type A to Type C cable - Used to connect to the cars wired Apple CarPlay port
USB Type A+Type A to Type C Y Cable - Some cars do not have sufficient power output to power this device, and in this case, additional power needs to be supplied through the Y cable
USB Type A to USB Type C Adaptor - For cars with type-c input for CarPlay
Mini HDMI to HDMI - To connect an external monitor like a rear entertainment unit using a full sized HDMI port
SIM Ejector Pin - To remove the SIM and memory card tray
Boot, Setup, Tweaks and pre-installed apps removal
I used the USB A to USB C cable to connect to the CarPlay port. I was a little worried because many of the users had reported that they had to use the Y cable for additional power for powering the device. I wanted to avoid this as first it then takes two USB ports but also it becomes a little too clumsy. But luckily, the power output was sufficient. The device lit-up with colors changing from green to red to blue and it was really bright as well. Good thing is there is an option to change the LED color mode, and most importantly it allows to completely turn the LED off. It took about 25 seconds for the first boot because it automatically detects the device resolution and restarts the device. Once it rebooted, I noticed that the resolution was too high, and it was not very usable as the fonts and the icons were small. There were also three big static widgets that were ugly and really was not looking good on the HU. There were also a lot of pre-installed applications.
I quickly realized the implemented UI was very archaic and needed a lot of tweaks. Since I have good experience with Android and customization in general, thanks to my xda days, I started by seeing what options I had out of the box before deciding the need to root the device. Though I was still limited to how much I could customize, I could get to a point that I was happy without needing to root. A short list of the things that I did.
Updated to the latest firmware. The firmware updates are done through an app and not the official android system. But was surprising to see multiple updates as I expected none. The updates were mostly some minor fixes and updates, nothing major.
Added an Airtel SIM Card and a 128GB SanDisk SD Extreme Pro SD Card.
Removed all pre-installed applications like HBO Max, Waze etc.
Turned off the ugly widgets.
Increased the Magnification/Icon Size and Font Size.
Turned off Right Hand Drive Mode - Because this aligns the applications in the app drawer to the right which is not very intuitive to use for me.
Installed Tasker and added a profile to turn on the Wi-Fi Hotspot on boot.
Enabled Call Barring to ensure that the SIM installed in the device does not get any incoming calls.
Removed Calls and SMS permissions from all applications.
Set default assistant to Google Assistant.
Set default navigation to Google Maps.
Setup Wireless AndroidAuto/Apple CarPlay through the ZLink app just in case.
Overall Performance and Initial Impressions
Hardware wise the device is impressive inside-out. I have mentioned enough about the specs, but I must also mention the the casing feels very well made, light and easy to carry around if needed. Once I set everything up to my liking, it is a breeze to use the device. I just get in the car, use the voice command button on the steering to navigate to my destination and it works flawlessly. My phone is connected to the device&#8217;s Bluetooth normally for music and calls.
Performance wise, the device is a lot quicker than I expected, in the sense, it boots up in parallel with the cars infotainment and in about 10-15 seconds, it fully boots up.
If you setup wireless android auto or Apple CarPlay with ZLink, then post boot up of device it also automatically connects to AA/CarPlay all under 30 seconds. Another thing I noticed was that when played directly from the device the audio output is much better than any other input modes that I have tried. I am not able to figure out why this might be the case, as the box at the end of the day uses the same CarPlay port as my phone.
The 5G performance is exceptional, I consistently get over 150Mbps, and sometimes even recorded 500+Mbps. The hotspot also is WiFi6 so the connected devices also get access to good speeds.
All other android based car applications can be used, like for example, I was able to install my dashcam app, making it easier to offload files to the sd card on board, change settings and view feed. Once can also add a CANBUS based device to connect with the device via Bluetooth, etc. Thinking slightly out of the box, the device also has some other out of car use cases, specially while travelling.
Wi-Fi Hotspot.
Can connect to any HDMI port in say a hotel TV/Airbnb to access all your content.
Can also be paired with a mini projector.
It can also handle some games like Asphalt and supports controllers too.
I am very happy with the device and its performance. I will consider rooting in the long run as that would open up a whole lot of options.
Conclusion and Recommendations
Good hardware, let down by mediocre software.
I am happy with the device but I cannot imagine an average user having to do all these tweaks to have an acceptable experience. The other problem is also powering the device itself, from what I read online, many of the older and some of the newer cars need the Y cable to provide sufficient power. If you want something that is the best available that money can buy, then do go ahead and buy it, but what I would recommend for others is the SD662 based box (called as iHeylinkit CP608 Ultra) for around $150-$170, features the same UI, casing with HDMI out, and offers good acceptable performance, with 4G connectivity, which should be more than sufficient for all major use cases, I would also suggest talking to the vendor over WhatsApp to better understand the differences between all the available models, to select the one that would suit your needs best.
If you need only Wireless CarPlay/Android Auto stick with well known adapters like Carlinkit as they are affordable and offer a no-nonsense experience out of the box. Autokit based wireless AA/Carplay implementations generally perform better than ZLink. Ottocast and Carlinkit also have their own custom skin on the UI which in my opinion are better than the generic ones. You will be paying more for these brands, but it may be worth it as it can save a lot of hassle.",2024-03-28 12:50:00,,https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/car-entertainment/278681-carplay-box-iheylinkit-cp908-review.html,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,team-bhp,,,,,,,,,,,,en, , , , , , ,,,

True, before my purchase of a FASTag, I was having a chat with Amazon support, and they couldn't answer a simple question: whether the payment would be debited directly from Amazon Pay or if I should recharge it separately. The answer I kept receiving was that I could recharge any FASTag using Amazon Pay balance. I tried to explain to them if it would function as a wallet or a Paytm model, but their response kept circling back to the option of recharging FASTag from Amazon Pay balance.

Sometime later, I placed the order for the second car, made the payment which was shown as successful, but no track of this order anywhere other than the transaction history where the amount was deducted.
I got an SMS the same day saying the fastag request has been validated successfully, but only for the first order.
It's been 5 days now, and there is no indication of the fastag being issued or shipped. And till now there is no reference to the second order. I checked the

I got another Airtel post paid connection as well which I took and gave my wife at same cost 10 years ago. But their international packs are costly for post paid compared to pre paid. I never tried any other provider like BSNL or Jio. My dad has both Airtel (migrated from Aircel) and Jio (only for social media) pre paid and don't face much issues with both of them. Recently Airtel had outages couple of times and it become a pain with complete outage. But Airtel data connectivity is terrible in central Chennai areas like Anna Nagar due to congestion. It can't even open any app properly. Yesterday faced the same in Ciclo cafe, Uthandi ECR.

My broadband experience with Airtel is not great. First I had it in 2008 time frame in Bangalore it waa good and when I switched home to another area, they refused transfer and I fought hard to get it. But the connection will often gets broken and I was told to get a higher plan like 3000 per month to avoid issues. Once it was down for 2 weeks and I refused to pay for the period it is not working and asked to close it with payment for working period. They refused and kept reminding. Finally they sent a lawyer notice and hilariously one lawyer called and threatened that I may never be able to travel abroad if they file a case. I challenged them to go ahead and told will file a case against him and Airtel. Then got a call from Nodal officer who decided to accept my version and waived the non working period fee and paid only the due to close the case.

I used to work for an American MNC in Bangalore. Before the time of cell phones arrived, my company used to provide BSNL landlines at employees' homes.
I needed to shift to an apartment right above the one I had been living in. So the landline connection needed to be shifted too. No big deal, -- it just needed disconnecting the BSNL wires from one set of wires going to the old apartment to another set (meant for the new apartment) only a few inches apart inside the building shaft for cables.
An application for the shift was submitted to the relevant BSNL office by my company along with all supporting documents and the requisite fee.
--- Weeks passed, with nothing happening. Now
I
was supposed to follow it up with BSNL to get it done. I was new to Bangalore, and new to working life in India. So my local coleagues advised me about what was going on. And of course, it needed greasing of palms if I wanted to get it done soon! --- I was not willing to do that.
So, I got my hands into the building shaft, and did the few minutes' job of disconnection and reconnection of the relevant wires myself! --- Job done, and my phone in the new apartment started working. Easy! And I was happy.
So, of course, I bragged about it to my coleagues. To my surprise, they were not impressed! I had done something illegal, and I could get in trouble with BSNL!
Scared, I undid what I had done to get my phone working, -- but I was not going to grease any palms (this attitude has made many things very difficult for me in India all my life, but I can honestly hold my head high, -- to myself)!
Finally, a full 3 months after application for the shift and fee payment, BSNL gave up, and completed the job without bribes! I didn't really have to go through much hardship for the lack of a phone at home, because I was living alone, and spent most of my waking hours at work.
---- My American MNC had to maintain a separate department staffed with local people to keep things running ""smoothly"" with various government departments in Bangalore! I have no idea how the necessary grease money was acounted for in the company books! All I know is that the US staff in the know used to laugh about this additional cost of doing business in India, and that made me feel very proud as an Indian!
The top people of this special department earned much more than us poor engineers, and used to flaunt their costly house and such too (that we couldn't even dream of buying ourselves)!
The whole idea of opening a design center in India meant cost savings for my company compared to the US. So indirectly this additional cost of doing business in India actually came out of the paychecks of us engineers of a technology company, whether or not we paid any grease money directly out of our pockets ourselves!

It's true that the Airtel app doesn't compare well to the usability of Paytm. Perhaps in the future, it will improve. But so far its good for me.

I wonder how can one be in the situation of puzzled billing for mobile services in the era of unlimited calling facility available at fixed price plans!
I have switched onto Airtel Black plan for 3 of my connections long ago. One is my postpaid number, another addition is my son's number which I got last year and third is my 100mbps broadband plan.
The total bill for all these three services is Rs. 1649.64 constant every month where everything is unlimited except the shared mobile data which always shows 300+ GB available every month.
Although I had different package few months ago which used to cost couple of hundred more than the current in the Airtel Black but later switched onto current plan which I find indifferent compared to the previous once for the facilities I need or use.
But the bills remained constant every month in either of the plans for me.
My only complaint is the deteriorating  and unreliable quality of mobile network, be it Airtel, Vi or anything else.
Ironically the mobile is no more mobile where and when we desperately need it as a mobile, rest of the time we depend on the broadband, even for mobile services (many calls these days are received or made as WiFi calls).",2024-03-13 21:25:00,,https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/gadgets-computers-software/278093-getting-new-sim-jio-airtel-bsnl-2.html,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,team-bhp,,,,,,,,,,,,en, , , , , , ,,,

@tbppjpr, Thanks. This is helpful.
@izzikio_rage - There are charges that comes along with the Airtel Savings Bank Accounts such as Account Facilitation Charges / Annual Subscription Charges, Account Operation Charges, SMS Alert Charges etc., - Please read more at

I want to see how Airtel and Jio compare in the localities where I spend time.
In our current residence, family uses Jio, Airtel, BSNL and Vodafone. All 4 providers have good coverage in our area. Jio and Airtel, with decent '5G'. Vodafone ironically has the highest speeds on 4G, easily 65-70Mbps, maybe due to hardly any users!! My obervation has been that Jio 5G speeds are higher on the top tier Samsung flagships compared to mid budget Xiaomi's and others.
FYI- if anyone is opting for online SIM request, please make sure to complete activation of the tariff plan on the spot, check for a range of plans which the rep can show you on his official Jio app, and you can confirm. There is also a e-PDF bill which is instantly generated and sent. Not a single penny extra, neither any upselling.",2024-03-10 22:23:00,,https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/gadgets-computers-software/83859-android-thread-phones-apps-mods-2166.html,,Bangalore,Karnataka,India,,,,,,,,,,,,team-bhp,,,,,,,,,,,,en, , , , , , ,,,

I&#39;ve been using Airtel in Visakhapatnam without any major technical issues (other than the occasional payments issues), so I&#39;m more interested in taking that. However the family that lives below us use Hathway, and he says he&#39;s faced no issues with them in the four years they&#39;ve used it, while also casually mentioning that outages usually last for ""just 24hrs or so"". My main concern is A. outages, and B. latency, as I heard Jio Fiber is not great for online multiplayer and other low-latency workloads, and I&#39;m worried Hathway might have some catch like this as well. &#x200B; Any help is appreciated Thanks in advance.    &#32; submitted by &#32;  /u/sid41299  &#32; to &#32;  r/hyderabad   [link] &#32; [comments]",2024-03-10 15:27:56,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1bb6slm/best_internet_provider_for_anand_baghsafilguda/,Male,Visakhapatnam,Andhra pradesh,India,,,,,,,,,,,,reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,en, , , , , , ,,,

I had been using the Airtel wallet since many years for my Airtel bill payments. Recently upgraded to the Airtel Payments bank account and started using it for regular digital payments at local vendors and the experience has been smooth so far.
But faced one issue, my Airtel wallet got disappeared along with the balance in it when I upgraded to the Airtel Payments bank account. I had to do few follow ups with them and had to go through some formal process to get the balance credited back into my bank account. They say that wallet closes down if the Airtel Payments bank account gets activated.
So if you are already using the wallet and want to upgrade to the payments bank then first clean out the old balance to save yourself from the hectic process.
The Airtel Payments bank account is like any other bank account. But the advantage is we can have the small digital payments separate from our primary bank account to keep our bank statements clean from the small transactions.
Another advantage is we are eligible for the 7% interest if we maintain the monthly average balance of Rs. one lakh or above.
Recently also got the Airtel Fastage, though haven't yet installed it because the old Paytm Fastage sticker has left it's glue on the windscreen and I want to stick the new Airtel Fastag at the same place.
I opened this thread to ask the solution to clean the Fastag sticker glue from the windscreen and found your post.
Any help for cleaning the old Fastag sticker glue is highly appreciated.",2024-03-09 21:10:00,,https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/street-experiences/179085-fastag-all-you-need-know-about-procuring-using-432.html,,,,India,,,,,,,,,,,,team-bhp,,,,,,,,,,,,en, , , , , , ,,,
